## Web developer

I am a web development graduate based in Valencia, Spain, specializing primarily in Java Spring Boot for back-end development. While I am still learning about the front-end, I have experience in Angular and JavaScript.

I am always striving to expand my knowledge and embrace new challenges, which has led me to develop several repositories with Spring Boot, as an authentication template or a REST API for a blog. Some projects I'm proud of are a Parchees game in Java vanilla, which was my final project for my first course, and a fire predictor developed during the NASA Hackathon Space Apps 2023.

Currently, I am involved in developing a web image gallery and am also studying a specialization course in Cloud Computing, specifically focusing on AWS.

I am eager to continue learning and growing in the web development field!
